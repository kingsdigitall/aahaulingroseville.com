  "faq": [
    {
      "ques": "What size dumpster do I need?",
      "ans": "The right dumpster size depends on your project. A 10-yard dumpster is great for small home cleanouts and yard debris, while a 15-20-yard dumpster works well for medium renovations and roofing projects. For large construction jobs and major remodels a 30-40 yard dumpster is the best choice."
    },
    {
      "ques": "How long can I keep the dumpster?",
      "ans": "We offer flexible rental periods to match your project needs, whether you need a dumpster for a day, a week, or longer. If you require an extension, just let us know, and we’ll arrange it at an affordable rate."
    },
    {
      "ques": "What items can I dispose of in a dumpster?",

    {
      "ques": "Do I need a permit for a dumpster rental?",
